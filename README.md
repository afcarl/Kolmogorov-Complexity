# Kolmogorov Complexity

In this project, you are required to write a program as short as possible that outputs the same input file. Auxiliary files are permitted, but the length of them should also be taken into account.

Your program will be compiled using minGW with command

```
mingw32-g++ -o prog.exe prog.cpp
```

----

# input1, input2, and input3

Compression using PPM and arithmetic coding.

Fine tuned individually to achieve the best performance.

# input4

Random with seed 1.

# input5

JPG file. Retriving by accessing the remote server. (github 233)
